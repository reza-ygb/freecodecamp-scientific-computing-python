# FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains my solutions for the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification from FreeCodeCamp. This certification focuses on Python fundamentals and scientific computing concepts.

## 📋 Projects Overview

This certification includes 5 comprehensive projects that demonstrate various Python programming concepts:

### ✅ Project 1: Arithmetic Formatter
**Status: Completed**

A function that arranges arithmetic problems vertically and side by side, making them easier to read and solve.

**Features:**
- Formats addition and subtraction problems vertically
- Handles input validation (digit-only numbers, operator validation, etc.)
- Optional display of answers
- Clean, aligned output format

**Example Output:**
```
   34      285      254      542
+ 658    -  49    +  18    - 412
-----    -----    -----    -----
  692      236      272      130
```
